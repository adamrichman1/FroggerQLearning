In order to get frogger to work you need to install a few things.

PYGAME

To install pygame locally, run:
python -m pip install pygame --user

PLE:
In the frogger directory: mkdir PyGame-Learning-Environment
git clone https://github.com/ntasfi/PyGame-Learning-Environment ./PyGame-Learning-Environment
cd PyGame-Learning-Environment
pip install -e .

To run frogger use randomAgent.py:
python randomAgent.py

It is currently set up so the agent doesn't do anything, which enables
you to play the game with the keyboard.  The keys are w,a,s,d to move
the frog.  The function pickAction() is where you will write your
agent. The return of the function is the "keystroke" to move the frog,
K_w,K_a,K_s,K_d.  The arguments to the function are the reward you
received for your last action/state, and the current game state.  The
reward is just an integer.  The state looks like this: 

{'homeR': [<rect(19, 62, 26, 36)>, <rect(115, 62, 26, 36)>, <rect(211,
62, 26, 36)>, <rect(307, 62, 26, 36)>, <rect(403, 62, 26, 36)>],
'homes': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'rect_w': 24, 'cars': [<rect(-4, 418, 32,
28)>, <rect(140, 418, 32, 28)>, <rect(23, 388, 28, 24)>, <rect(151,
388, 28, 24)>, <rect(279, 388, 28, 24)>, <rect(35, 358, 30, 20)>,
<rect(163, 358, 30, 20)>, <rect(291, 358, 30, 20)>, <rect(63, 322, 32,
28)>, <rect(70, 294, 54, 20)>, <rect(246, 294, 54, 20)>], 'rivers':
[<rect(118, 229, 94, 26)>, <rect(374, 229, 94, 26)>, <rect(222, 198,
84, 20)>, <rect(162, 133, 62, 26)>, <rect(90, 102, 116, 20)>,
<rect(246, 229, 94, 26)>, <rect(414, 198, 84, 20)>, <rect(386, 133,
62, 26)>, <rect(59, 166, 180, 20)>, <rect(266, 102, 116, 20)>,
<rect(315, 166, 180, 20)>, <rect(274, 133, 62, 26)>, <rect(442, 102,
116, 20)>, <rect(50, 133, 62, 26)>, <rect(-10, 229, 94, 26)>,
<rect(30, 198, 84, 20)>], 'frog_y': 485.0, 'frog_x': 224.0, 'rect_h':
24}

where 'homeR' is the locations of the frog homes, 'homes' is a list of
whether or not each home is fllled, 'cars' is a list of car locations,
'rivers' is a list of river objects, and 'frog_x' and 'frog_y' are the
x,y position of the frog.  Those 'rects' are rectangles with the first
two numbers being the upper left corner, and the next two being width
and height of the rectangle.  More about Rects can be found here
